# Party Invitation

Parchment-style paper

Sealed with wax (Brian's Celtic set or Hogwarts one??)



## Random drafts of wording...

We are pleased to inform you that you have been invited to attend our secret Advanced Potions Class to be held at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. 

Wands will be provided. There is no specific dress code, but records show that students perform better when wearing appropriate attire: capes, robes, dress robes, bath robes, pointed hats with stars, pointed dunce caps, wild and outlandish hats, house colors, etc.

Students shall be required to report to the Enigma Reception Chamber
upon arrival, the muggle entrance of which is located at 5515 SE Lafayette.

Arrive by any convenient method — including but not limited to: broomstick, port key, [flying] muggle car, flying motorcycle (with sidecar), thestrals, steam train, apparating, or any other method except floo powder, as the Floo Network is being closely monitored by the Ministry of Magic (not because the school has no chimney).

We very much look forward to receiving you as part of the new 
generation of Hogwarts’ heritage. Please RSVP at your earliest convenience via Owl Post, iMessage, or Tweets.
