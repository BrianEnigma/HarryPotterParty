## Random drafts of wording...

Arrive by any convenient method — including but not limited to: broomstick, port key, [flying] muggle car, flying motorcycle (with sidecar), [TKTK more here] — anything except floo [TKTK spelling?] powder. The school has no chimney.

Wands will be provided. There is no specific dress code, but records show that students perform better when wearing appropriate attire: capes, robes, dress robes, bath robes, pointed hats with stars, pointed dunce caps, wild and outlandish hats, house colors.
