# Party Invitation

Parchment-style paper

Sealed with wax (Brian's Celtic set or Hogwarts one??)



## Random drafts of wording...

Arrive by any convenient method — including but not limited to: broomstick, port key, [flying] muggle car, flying motorcycle (with sidecar), [TKTK more here] — anything except floo [TKTK spelling?] powder. The school has no chimney.

Wands will be provided. There is no specific dress code, but records show that students perform better when wearing appropriate attire: capes, robes, dress robes, bath robes, pointed hats with stars, pointed dunce caps, wild and outlandish hats, house colors.

### **Harry Potter invitations:**

Making envelopes and letters. 

Including McGonagall's signature (in "Lumos" font, or perhaps Snape or Slughorn for potions?) and Hogwarts crest for the letterhead.
