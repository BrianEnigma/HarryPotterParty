## MP3 Setup

The actual mp3 media files are not committed to git. You will need:

- In this folder, base.mp3. This is the long-running base background sound. For this project, the Forbidden Forest, it is a mellow 1-hour forest sounds track intended to help you sleep. [A Night in the Forest (Nature Sounds)](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B005FC9XKG/ref=oh_aui_d_detailpage_o01_?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
- In the Effects folder, a collection of short mp3 files, starting with 01.mp3 and going up to whatever. In my case, it was 33.mp3. These are the sounds effects that occasionally get overlaid on the base mp3. I picked a couple of dozen from [Horror Soundscapes, Halloween Haunted House Ambience, Scary Sound Effects](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B0044BEY3A/ref=oh_aui_d_detailpage_o01_?ie=UTF8&psc=1).
