# Food

Most food items to be small(ish), no more than a few bites. Reasoning below.

- Finger cookies â€” The sugar cookies shaped like fingers, fingernail made of a sliced almond, affixed with red sugar icing.

- Pumpkin pasties: pumpkin, cheese (vegan?), sage

- Licorice wands: licorice ropes dipped in icing and rolled in sprinkles at one end  (or make? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgQ5doxKt2E :: http://rosannapansino.com/blog/recipes/harry-potter-licorice-wand/)

- Pumpkin Spice Madelines

- Something cool from the creepy bakery book as food centerpiece (use glass test tube for dry ice effect stuck in center for safety)

- Cauldron Cakes!!!!  (https://www.cookingchanneltv.com/recipes/rosanna-pansino/cauldron-cake-pops-3147196) -- Cauldron Cake Pops, since Silicone Cauldrons look unlikely.

- Skull cupcakes

- Bertie Botts (little boxes)

- Molded (dark) chocolate (pumpkins, cauldrons, skeletons, dragons??) FROGS!!!




My instinct is to go big, but the reality is we'll likely have so so so many leftovers! Perhaps a single, impressive centerpiece, like something from the Creepy Baker book and/or an actual smoking cauldron (from the one Brian has in the kitchen) that's only for looks (dry ice in that??) -- and then an impressive food item.

Another possibiltiy is to make a large Cauldron Cake, but then it's a whole cake! It's likely better to have little individual things like cake pops....
