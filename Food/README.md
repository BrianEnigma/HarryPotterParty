# Food

Most food items to be small(ish), no more than a few bites. Reasoning below.

### SWEET

- Finger cookies â€” The sugar cookies shaped like fingers, fingernail made of a sliced almond, affixed with red sugar icing.
- Licorice wands: licorice ropes dipped in icing and rolled in sprinkles at one end  (or make? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgQ5doxKt2E :: http://rosannapansino.com/blog/recipes/harry-potter-licorice-wand/)
- Pumpkin Spice Madelines
- ~~Something cool from the creepy bakery book as food centerpiece (use glass test tube for dry ice effect stuck in center for safety)~~
- Cauldron Cakes!!!!  (https://www.cookingchanneltv.com/recipes/rosanna-pansino/cauldron-cake-pops-3147196) -- Cauldron Cake Pops, since Silicone Cauldrons look unlikely.
- Skull cupcakes
- Bertie Botts (little boxes) -- or emptied into a bowl??
- Molded (dark) chocolate frogs
- Snitch Cake Pops

### SAVORY

- [Pumpkin pasties](,http://www.bijouxandbits.com/2015/08/pumpkin-pasties-harry-potter-recipe/): pumpkin, cheese (vegan?), sage

My instinct is to go big, but the reality is we'll likely have so so so many leftovers! Perhaps a single, impressive centerpiece, like something from the Creepy Baker book and/or an actual smoking cauldron (from the one Brian has in the kitchen) that's only for looks (dry ice in that??) -- and then an impressive food item.

Another possibiltiy is to make a large Cauldron Cake, but then it's a whole cake! It's likely better to have little individual things like cake pops....
