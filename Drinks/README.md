THOUGHTS:

1. If we have ~8 (two in each of 4) of main ingredients that can be mixed / matched, should we then have more than 5 drinks in the booklet?
2. Perhaps we can make up a batch of pre-made "polyjuice potion" in one of the large erlenmeyer flasks (gin, green juice, chartreuse, lime jucie, sprite) that people don't have to mix (??) ...
