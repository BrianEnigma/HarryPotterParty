# Pumpkin Juice

TODO: Try this one out and see if it's good. Serving container? Does it need a label like the butterbeer?

## Ingredients

- Actual 'pumpkin juice'
    - half of a butternut squash
    - 2 cups water
- Harry Potter Pumpkin Juice
    - 1.25 cup pumpkin juice
    - 3 cups apple juice
    - 1/2 cup apricot nectar
    - 1/2 tsp vanilla essence
    - 2 tsp pumpkin pie spice
    - 1/2 cup sugar


## Directions

- Start by placing your half a pumpkin or squash in a baking tray lined with a layer of water. Roast for approx 40 minutes at 180C until soft when fork is pressed in.
- Remove from oven, cool and remove skin.
- In a blender, combine the squash and water and blend. You can also put the pumpkin through the juicer, following it with water (putting just the pumpkin through does next to nothing).
- In a saucepan, combine the 1.25 cups of the pumpkin juice with the apple juice, apricot nectar, vanilla essence, 2 tsp pumpkin pie spice and sugar. Bring to a boil then reduce to a simmer for 20-30 minutes.
- The whole point of this? By simmering you'll be reducing the water so it'll have a more concentrated taste and will help the spices infuse with the juices, which plays a big part in the taste.
- Chill and serve (although served hot is wonderful too!)
