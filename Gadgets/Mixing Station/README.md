# Lightup Mixing Stations



## Design Notes/Essentials

- Need hole for power adapter.
- Need spot for magnetic sensor (drill or route this out?).
- Need room (height) for LEDs, the depth of the power plug, and the circuit board.
- Different colors of wood/acrylic?
- Spooky/magic design etched into acrylic? Sigil of some kind? But nothing with a “real” magickal meaning.
  - Etched sigil doesn't really show up. Fill it with paint? Brush? Spraycan?
- LEDs do a slow-to-fast spin animation, appearing a little bit like it's mixing/spinning.
