# Random Notes

- Need small test-tube racks so students can carry their ingredients to a mixing station? Probably, yes. Simple, small. Rectangular? Circular? Looks worn, like it caught on fire once?

- Goblet of fire? What would it be for? Decoration? Put name in for some reason?
- Triwizard cup?
- House decor?
    - Spine candle
    - Lighting
